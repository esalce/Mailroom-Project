Mailroom-Project
================
Welcome to th Mailroom Project for Morrisville State College. 

Morrisville came to the students of the CITA 450 Class (Database Applied Manager Course) of 2012, 
to develop a system where they can keep track of the incoming/outgoing mail of the students on campus. 

The current system Morrisville had was a paper based system where they kept track of the students packages by hand. We
were brought in to auto-mate this process
